    "\n",
    "Remember the syntax if passing by reference: (the DECLARATION and INITIALISATION must happen at the same time)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int &y = x\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So , by using &a in signature is similar to above syntax, as can be written as:\n",

    "&a = x\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we \"Obtained x\" as reference, i.e x and a is mates, infact x and s is same person.\n",

    "In fact, to not create a as a separate variable, i.e. create new address space, we add &a, so its same variable as x.\n",
