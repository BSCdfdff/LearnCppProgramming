    "    Using \"friend function\" is not as nice, since, we then need to pass the objects as parameters (not such a nice cleatr design). So previously, whatever variable I wanted to use inside the function, I could simply just use it, as it was part of th class. Now seeing that the function is outside the class (and there is no scope resolution operator, although it is defined with \"friend function\", I need to pass whatever i need to use inside the function as parameter to it) So more variable, just to use the function outside the class.\n",
